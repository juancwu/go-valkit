# go-valkit
This Go package provides an extensible validation framework with enhanced error handling, designed for web applications (especially those using the Echo framework). It offers:

- Custom validation rules (e.g., password complexity)
- Structured error formatting for nested fields, arrays, and objects
- Localizable error messages with field/tag-specific overrides
- Seamless integration with go-playground/validator and Echo

Ideal for APIs requiring detailed validation feedback and consistent error structures.
